# Setting up

1. Set up a library

1.1. In your home folder (type cd on the command line to navigate to home - should see something along the lines of [<USERNAME>@cyan53 ~]$), 
paste the commands into iridis one by one:

nano .Renviron                                                                      # Opens up / creates a new file with this name in a text editor
R_LIBS_USER=/home/<USERNAME>/software/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1.1           # Paste into the window
>>> press ctrl and o then enter                                                     # Saves your file
>>> press ctrl and x 								    # Exits nano (the text editor)
exit                                                                                # Will exit the session

1.2. Start a new session and paste the commands into iridis one by one:

module list                                  # Look at which modules are loaded. 
module load R/4.1.1 gcc/10.3.0               # Loads modules needed for R
R                                            # Starts R 
install.packages("BiocManager")              # Installs a package called BiocManager
yes                                          # First message
yes                                          # Second message (yes *if* it quotes the filpath you entered earlier)



2. Installing pandoc 

2.1. Paste the commands into iridis one by one

module list         # Ensure R/4.1.1 gcc/10.3.0 are loaded
cd                  # Moves to your home directory
mkdir pandoc        # Makes a directory for pandoc
cd pandoc           # Moves into the directory for pandoc
wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/2.11.1.1/pandoc-2.11.1.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz   # Downloads pandoc
tar -xvf pandoc-2.11.1.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz   # Unzips it
cd                  # Goes back to your home folder
nano .bashrc        # Goes into a text editor for a hidden file called .bashrc

2.2. Under line 1 paste:

module load R/4.1.1 gcc/10.3.0

2.3. Under user specific aliases and functions (line 8) paste:

export PATH=/mainfs/home/<YOUR USERNAME>/pandoc/pandoc-2.11.1.1/bin:$PATH  # Put your user name in

>>> press ctrl and o then enter
>>> press ctrl and x

2.4. Paste these commands into Iridis

source .bashrc

module list # if R and gcc arent loaded then run below
module load R/4.1.1
module load gcc/10.3.0

R

2.5. In r

install.packages("rmarkdown") # if needed
rmarkdown::pandoc_available(version = NULL, error = FALSE) # hopefully should say TRUE
